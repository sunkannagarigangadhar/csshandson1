<i><h2 class="heading">What is CSS?</h2></i>
<ol>

<li>CSS stands for Cascading style sheets.</li>


<li> CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen,paper,or in other media.</li>

<li><b><span style="text-decoration: line-through;"> CSS is not neccesary</span><span class="background"">CSS saves a lot of work.</span></b>  It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once</li>

<li style="text-decoration: underline;"><i>External stylesheets are stored in CSS files.</i></li>

</ol>
<i><h2 class="heading">CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h2></i>
<ul>

    <li>Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elementsl</li>
    <li>Internal - by using a style element in the head section</li>
    <li>External - by using a link element to link to an external CSS file.</li>
    <li>The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external CSS files. However,<b> <span class="background"> in this 
        tutorial we will use inline and internal styles,</span></b> because this is easier to demonstrate, and easier
        for you to try it yourself.
    </li>

</ul>
<p class="para2">When comparing CSS class vs ID,the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements.ID,on the other hand,applies a style to one unique element. ID is also
    special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and it's used by Javascript.
</p>
<p class="para2">in CSS,selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a web page. Once an element has been targeted,a style can be applied to the 
    element.
</p>
<p class="para2">There is a wide range of selectors available.Two of the most commonly used are class and ID. Both are used to target elements to which a styles can be applied.
